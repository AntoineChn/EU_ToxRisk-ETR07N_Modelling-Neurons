# Note for Johannes's new dataset recieved 7th aug 2019

## About the explaination in Johannes's email

### How to use the data of cII and cIII ?

> Keep in mind that a cIII inhibition produces an apparent cI inhibition, since the electrons fed into cI (to assess its activity) need to go through cIII to consume oxygen at cIV (what we measure). A schematic representation of this can be found in Fig. 7 and Suppl. Item 4 of the attached PDF.



## General remarks

### Concentrations

- Multiple concentrations / replicats (2-8 reps) on the same chemical (rotenone and deguelin)

VS

- Multiple chemicals (12 chemicals) but 
    - one concentration per chemical (different chemical different concentration)
    - 2-4 reps

### Chemicals

Some Chemicals only exit in the datasheets of KE1 and KE2.


## KE1

### General remarks

We have not only complex **I** but also complex **II** and / or **III** on some chemicals

### Activity VS inhibition

- On "rotanone" CI activity

VS

- On "other" CI inhibition !!! inhibition = 100%- measured cI activity

Remark : Inibition can goes to negative values

### Control group : invented values

- on "rotanone" 90, 100, 110

vs

- "other : 75, 100, 125
  
----

## KE2

Nothing special to remark


# Quoi faire avec nouveaux jeux de donnÃ©e

- Compare Rotenon and deguelin

- re-calibrate $x_{50}$ for each chemical

# To-do list

before the 5th september 2019

- Rotenone / Degueline
    - Refine model KE1 -> KE4
    - Validation of chimical independent hypothesis of qAOP
- ~~If chimical dependent then Predictive check on Rotenone~~
- Predictive check on other chemicals
